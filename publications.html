                                <p> Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides simultaneous measurement of homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths through quantitative line shape analysis. However, conventional line shape analysis methods assume Gaussian inhomogeneity, limiting its applicability to systems with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. We present a quantitative line shape analysis method incorporating arbitrary inhomogeneity using a bivariate spectral distribution function in 2DCS simulations. An algorithm is developed to extract the homogeneous linewidth and arbitrary inhomogeneous distribution from an experimentally measured 2D spectrum. We demonstrate this framework for a quantum-well (QW)-exciton resonance with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. This work broadens the scope of quantitative line shape analysis for studying materials with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity.</p>

                                <p> The calculation of the coherent nonlinear response of a system is essential to correctly interpret results from advanced techniques such as two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy. Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a δ-function in time. Here, we use the phase-cycling method for the exact calculation of the nonlinear response without making the aforementioned approximations even for high-intensity excitation. We compare the simulation results to several experimental observations to prove the validity of these calculations. The saturation of the photon-echo signal from excitons in a semiconductor quantum well sample is measured. The excitation-intensity dependent measurement shows nonlinear contributions up to twelfth order. Intensity-dependent simulations reproduce this effect without explicitly considering higher-order interactions. In addition, we present simulation results that replicate previously reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signals, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation. This method would be particularly useful for systems with multiple, well-separated peaks and/or large inhomogeneities.</p>

                                <p> Many-body interactions such as exciton-exciton interactions significantly affect the optical response of semiconductor nanostructures. These interactions can be rigorously modeled through microscopic calculations. However, these calculations can be computationally intensive and often lack physical insights. An alternative is to use phenomenological many-body-interaction models such as the modified optical Bloch equations and the anharmonic oscillator model. While both these models have separately been used to interpret experimental data, to the best of our knowledge, an explicit and direct correspondence between these models has not been established. Here, we show the empirical equivalence between these two complimentary models through two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy simulations. A quantitative correspondence between the parameters used to incorporate the exciton-exciton interactions in these two models are obtained. We also perform a quantitative comparison of these phenomenological models with experiments, which highlights their usefulness in interpreting experimental results.</p>
